My name is Grazi Azevedo, but I prefer to be called @gograzi. I'm studying to get a bachelor's degree in Analysis and System Dev, but my main interest is web dev, so I'm doing other courses as wel. I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects with translation pt-br/en.
I like to read, to learn and to code (:
