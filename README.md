My name is Grazi Azevedo, but I prefer to be called @gograzi. I'm studying to get a bachelor's degree in Analysis and System Dev @ FADERGS, but my main interest is web dev, so I'm doing other courses as well @ freeCodeCamp, DIO, Udacity and Shay Howe. I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects with translation pt-br/en.
I like to read, to learn and to code (:
