My name is Grazi Azevedo, but I prefer to be called @gograzi. I'm studying to get a bachelor's degree in Cyber Security @ UniRitter, as well as doing some free courses in web dev (front end) and technical documentation writing @ freeCodeCamp, Udacity, Google Developers and edX. I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects with translation pt-br/en.
I like to read, to learn and to code (:
